# coding-problems
Just my own private solutions to the various challenges found on LeetCode, Kattis, or otherwise.

Currently supported languages:
1. Python
2. Rust
3. Haskell

This is mainly meant as my own personal resource and I do not endorse cheating by copy pasting these solutions in any way.
This is why I chose to use Haskell and Rust over C++ or Java.

I am also not an expert at this so these solutions may not be optimal and sometimes time out.
There are some problems marked as **solved** which are in fact not solved, and I have solved some problems but forgot to upload them.

Either way, don't copy paste code, that's ***BAD***, and I will be sad if you do :(
